# 4.2 The 5D model
# 4.2 5D模型

Back in sec. 3.6, we looked at Karl Tomm’s approach as a way of generating powerful questions. We can also look at it as a complete path through a team coaching conversation. We would apply the coaching conversation structure from sec. 3.5, keep the discussion flowing using active listening and use the powerful questions to create a coherent direction in the discussion.

回到第3.6节，我们可以把卡尔·汤姆的方法看作产生有力问题的一种方式，也可以把它看做是一条完整的团队教练谈话路径。我们可以应用第3.5节中谈到的教练谈话结构，使用积极倾听的方式保持谈话的流畅性，并利用强有力的问题在讨论中创造一个连贯的方向。

This approach works well enough for us to use it as the “default” in many coaching conversations. It works especially well in situations of conflict, because a large part of the discussion is spent on discovering facts together and creating a common understanding that includes different interpretations. It also works well if the team is aware of some pain point, but cannot formulate what it is.

对于我们来说，这种方法的效果已经足够好，在许多教练谈话中，也会被当作默认的方法。它在存在冲突的情况下特别有效，因为讨论的大部分时间都是用于一起发现事实，并形成包含不同解释的共同理解。在团队意识到一些痛点，但却不能明确的将其指出的情况下，这种方法也是非常有效的。

However, while Karl Tomm’s model is good at digging into the past, it is not as good at dreaming up ambitious goals. In this section we would like to introduce another path through a coaching conversation that we call the 5D Model. The 5D model helps the team choose or formulate the problem to be addressed; share past experiences that might be worth trying; explore what a great solution could look like; define the stepping stones towards this solution; and decide who is doing what. It can be especially useful if the team has found a problem that they want to solve either in an ad hoc discussion or in a separate retrospective meeting.

但是，卡尔·汤姆的模型着眼于挖掘过去的信息，却不擅长制定雄心勃勃的目标。在本节中，我们将要介绍一种称为5D模型的教练谈话路径。5D模型帮助团队选择或者明确要解决的问题，分享过去值得尝试的经验，探索一个伟大的解决方案应该是什么样子的，定义实现这个解决方案的路径，并决定由谁来执行。在某次特别的讨论或者单独的回顾会议上，当团队发现了一个他们想要解决的问题时，这种方法会非常有用。

The 5D Model, shown in fig. 4.2, is rooted in appreciative inquiry that we mentioned briefly in sec. 3.2. It consists of five phases: Define, Discover, Dream, Design and Deliver. You can run this as a guided discussion, or you can plan exercises to draw out the best ideas.

5D模型，如图4.2所示，是基于我们在第3.2节简单介绍的赞赏式询问建立起来的。它由五个阶段组成：定义，发现，设想，设计和实现。你可以把它当做引导式讨论来运作，也可以用于拟定最佳方案。

## Define
## 定义
In this phase, we define the topic we would like to develop in this coaching conversation. This phase is somewhat similar to establishing the contract in a classic coaching conversation. We describe the development area through “transforming questions” — questions that have a special power of change designed in. In contrast to problem-solving questions, transforming questions are constructive and positive and focus on the goal rather than the problem, as illustrated by the following example:
* Problem-solving question: “How do we prevent our meetings from being so boring and unimportant?”
* Transforming question: “How do we create dedicated meetings that help us realize the improvements we have set as goal?

在这个阶段，我们需要定义希望在教练谈话中讨论的主题。这个阶段有点类似于传统教练谈话中建立约定的过程，我们通过特别具有改进能量的变革型问题来描述要讨论的领域。与问题解决型的问题相比，变革型问题是有建设性的，是正向的，聚焦于目标而非困难，就如以下例子所示：
* 问题解决型问题：“我们怎样才能避免会议变得如此枯燥，如此不重要？”
* 变革型问题：“我们如何召开专门的会议来帮助我们实现设定的目标？”

As you can see, the basic principle here is to base the questions on the situation that you want to achieve rather than the situation you want to avoid. Problem-solving questions are not wrong as such, but they can drain the energy from the team. In our experience, team coaching discussions benefit from “dreaming big”. Be ambitious and stretch this goal by making it lofty, so that the questions will give constructive leverage later in the conversation.

如你所见，此处的基本原则是，问题要基于你要达成的目标而不是想要解避免的状况。问题解决型的问题本身并没有错，但它可能会打击团队的士气。根据我们的经验，团队辅导讨论往往得益于“敢于梦想”。要雄心勃勃，高调地设定目标，以便于这个问题在以后的谈话中发挥建设性的作用。

## Discover
## 发现
In this phase, you explore the past experiences of the team members with a focus on successful events and incidents. The purpose is to describe and explain the contexts that illustrates the best practice of the team members. It is important that the questions are as specific as possible.

在这个阶段，你要发掘团队成员过去的经历，重点关注成功的事件。目的是描述和解释在最佳实践的情况下团队成员的工作环境。问题要尽可能详细，这是非常重要的。

Because the team is focusing on the things where they have succeeded, we are already fostering the positive effect of the problem solving in this phase. If the team has little or no prior positive experiences related to the topic, ask the team members to think of other teams that have succeeded in similar situations. This can include teams that some of the members have been a part of in the past or neighbouring teams in the same company or competing companies or perhaps something from a book or article.

因为团队专注于成功的事情，所以在这个阶段我们已经培养了解决问题的积极效果。如果团队在这个领域很少或者基本没有成功的经验，可以要求团队成员思考其他团队在类似情况下的成功经验，可以是某些成员曾经待过的团队或者临近部门的兄弟团队，包括同一家公司的，竞争对手公司的，甚至是某一本书上或者文章中提到的，都可以。

As a coach, you can use multiple tools to facilitate and drive the workshop. If you run this as a discussion, remember to regularly sum up the experiences the team is talking about. You can also facilitate a Brainstorming exercise with stickies, or the Brainwriting variant that also activates silent members. If the group is large (15+ people) you could run a quick World Café.

作为一名教练，你可以使用多种工具来促进和推进工作坊的进程。如果你采用讨论的方式，记得要经常总结一下团队讨论到的经验。你可以使用贴纸进行头脑风暴法，或者书面头脑风暴法让沉默的成员参与进来。如果团队很大（15个人以上），你可以组织一场世界咖啡（World Café）的活动。

You can also split the team and give the groups different targets, e.g. one group to ideate and list mainstream ideas; one to work on the loftiest, most inspiring ideas; one to come up with the weirdest possible ideas; one on anti-ideas (ones that prevent you from achieving your goal); and so on. Make presentations or a gallery walk at the end to spread the knowledge around.

你也可以把团队分成小组，并给每个小组分配不同的目标，例如，一个小组罗列出各种想法；一个小组解决最崇高、最鼓舞人心的想法；一个小组构思最奇怪的想法；一个小组想办法阻止你完成目标，等等。结束时，做一下整体展示或者来回走动交流来同步各组之间的信息。

## Dream
## 设想
Having a common picture of the ideal situation for the team in the foreseeable future is a very powerful tool. It helps the team keep on track as they are improving. Here the focus is on the future and the team’s desire for ideal practices or an ideal situation. If “dreaming of the perfect future” feels too fuzzy or idealistic, you can instead use terms like “vision” or “ideas”.


At this stage, you should strive to create a playful and welcoming atmosphere — a “yes, and” mindset — so that team members gradually become bolder as they experience the friendly welcome of their ideas and imaginations. It is therefore important to avoid negative replies or rejection of a team member. Instead draw inspiration and build on top of the ideas of others, providing more details and offshoots of each other’s imaginations. All ideas are welcome

With minor changes, many tools from the Discover phase also work well in the Dream phase. If you facilitate a conversation, try using bridging questions to build a common understanding. You can also have multiple groups work on different perspectives on the same issue (for example People/Process/Product) and merge their results. You can also try the Park Bench or Fish Bowl exercises.

## Design
## 设计
Based on the wishes for the future and the best experiences of the past, we now examine which of the possible future situations will be of particular relevance to the team. We help the team define what approach or approaches they should focus on. Again, it is important to keep the wording as concrete and action-oriented as possible.

## Deliver
## 实现
In this final phase, the goal is to define the actions and plans of action to achieve the objectives. The responsibility is defined, so it is clear to everybody who is doing what and when. This clarification should be explicit and detailed, so no one is in doubt about his or her role in the near future. It should also be agreed about when to follow up, so the implementation can be secured and supported. The concept of SMART actions3 (SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) can be helpful.

Sometimes we find that teams are nervous about going forward with the concepts they have Dreamed and Designed. The concepts look good on paper, but reality strikes when they start drawing up concrete action plans. Throughout the Design and Deliver phases, keep an eye open for uncertainty. For example, we have found it useful to ask the team membersto individually judge how suretheyareabout theproposal. We ask them to think of a number from 0 to 10, where ten means absolute certainty and zero means that they really can’t say anything, then raise that number of fingers.

If it turns out that the team feels generally uncertain about the proposal, ask them what would increase the score. If there are different opinions
in the team, ask what makes people sure and what makes them unsure. If they still feel uncertain, help them create time-limited safe-to-fail experiments. The outcome of the actions will then be learning and knowledge.

The 5D model is a powerful and effective communication structure because it breaks the way we usually think of improvements. By anchoring the discussion in what has actually worked instead of what does not work, we can increase motivation and enthusiasm and pave the way for future learnings.

The model does put a lot of responsibility on the facilitator, though. As you will notice, guiding the team through the model takes some careful balancing between guarded optimism and, well, unguarded optimism. The “landing curve” from Dream into Delivery can be tricky, especially if the team you are coaching has been conditioned over the years not to rock the boat. Make sure to help them out: talk to the managers; drop some words in the right places; bring the stakeholders’ attention to the right issues.
