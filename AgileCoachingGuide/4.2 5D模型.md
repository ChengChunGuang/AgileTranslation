# 4.2 The 5D model
Back in sec. 3.6, we looked at Karl Tomm’s approach as a way of generating powerful questions. We can also look at it as a complete path through a team coaching conversation. We would apply the coaching conversation structure from sec. 3.5, keep the discussion flowing using active listening and use the powerful questions to create a coherent direction in the discussion.

This approach works well enough for us to use it as the “default” in many coaching conversations. It works especially well in situations of conflict, because a large part of the discussion is spent on discovering facts together and creating a common understanding that includes different interpretations. It also works well if the team is aware of some pain point, but cannot formulate what it is.

However, while Karl Tomm’s model is good at digging into the past, it is not as good at dreaming up ambitious goals. In this section we would like to introduce another path through a coaching conversation that we call the 5D Model. The 5D model helps the team choose or formulate the problem to be addressed; share past experiences that might be worth trying; explore what a great solution could look like; define the stepping stones towards this solution; and decide who is doing what. It can be especially useful if the team has found a problem that they want to solve either in an ad hoc discussion or in a separate retrospective meeting.

The 5D Model, shown in fig. 4.2, is rooted in appreciative inquiry that we mentioned briefly in sec. 3.2. It consists of five phases: Define, Discover, Dream, Design and Deliver. You can run this as a guided discussion, or you can plan exercises to draw out the best ideas.

## Define
In this phase, we define the topic we would like to develop in this coaching conversation. This phase is somewhat similar to establishing the contract in a classic coaching conversation. We describe the development area through “transforming questions” — questions that have a special power of change designed in. In contrast to problem-solving questions, transforming questions are constructive and positive and focus on the goal rather than the problem, as illustrated by the following example:
* Problem-solving question: “How do we prevent our meetings from being so boring and unimportant?”
* Transforming question: “How do we create dedicated meetings that help us realize the improvements we have set as goal?

As you can see, the basic principle here is to base the questions on the situation that you want to achieve rather than the situation you want to avoid. Problem-solving questions are not wrong as such, but they can drain the energy from the team. In our experience, team coaching discussions benefit from “dreaming big”. Be ambitious and stretch this goal by making it lofty, so that the questions will give constructive leverage later in the conversation.

## Discover
In this phase, you explore the past experiences of the team members with a focus on successful events and incidents. The purpose is to describe and explain the contexts that illustrates the best practice of the team members. It is important that the questions are as specific as possible.

Because the team is focusing on the things where they have succeeded, we are already fostering the positive effect of the problem solving in this
phase. If the team has little or no prior positive experiences related to the topic, ask the team members to think of other teams that have succeeded in similar situations. This can include teams that some of the members have been a part of in the past or neighbouring teams in the same company or competing companies or perhaps something from a book or article.

As a coach, you can use multiple tools to facilitate and drive the workshop. If you run this as a discussion, remember to regularly sum up the experiences the team is talking about. You can also facilitate a Brainstorming exercise with stickies, or the Brainwriting variant that also activates silent members. If the group is large (15+ people) you could run a quick World Café.

You can also split the team and give the groups different targets, e.g. one group to ideate and list mainstream ideas; one to work on the loftiest, most inspiring ideas; one to come up with the weirdest possible ideas; one on anti-ideas (ones that prevent you from achieving your goal); and so on. Make presentations or a gallery walk at the end to spread the knowledge around.

## Dream
Having a common picture of the ideal situation for the team in the foreseeable future is a very powerful tool. It helps the team keep on track as they are improving. Here the focus is on the future and the team’s desire for ideal practices or an ideal situation. If “dreaming of the perfect future” feels too fuzzy or idealistic, you can instead use terms like “vision” or “ideas”.


At this stage, you should strive to create a playful and welcoming atmosphere — a “yes, and” mindset — so that team members gradually become bolder as they experience the friendly welcome of their ideas and imaginations. It is therefore important to avoid negative replies or rejection of a team member. Instead draw inspiration and build on top of the ideas of others, providing more details and offshoots of each other’s imaginations. All ideas are welcome

With minor changes, many tools from the Discover phase also work well in the Dream phase. If you facilitate a conversation, try using bridging questions to build a common understanding. You can also have multiple groups work on different perspectives on the same issue (for example People/Process/Product) and merge their results. You can also try the Park Bench or Fish Bowl exercises.

## Design
Based on the wishes for the future and the best experiences of the past, we now examine which of the possible future situations will be of particular relevance to the team. We help the team define what approach or approaches they should focus on. Again, it is important to keep the wording as concrete and action-oriented as possible.

## Deliver
In this final phase, the goal is to define the actions and plans of action to achieve the objectives. The responsibility is defined, so it is clear to everybody who is doing what and when. This clarification should be explicit and detailed, so no one is in doubt about his or her role in the near future. It should also be agreed about when to follow up, so the implementation can be secured and supported. The concept of SMART actions3 (SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) can be helpful.

Sometimes we find that teams are nervous about going forward with the concepts they have Dreamed and Designed. The concepts look good on paper, but reality strikes when they start drawing up concrete action plans. Throughout the Design and Deliver phases, keep an eye open for uncertainty. For example, we have found it useful to ask the team membersto individually judge how suretheyareabout theproposal. We ask them to think of a number from 0 to 10, where ten means absolute certainty and zero means that they really can’t say anything, then raise that number of fingers.

If it turns out that the team feels generally uncertain about the proposal, ask them what would increase the score. If there are different opinions
in the team, ask what makes people sure and what makes them unsure. If they still feel uncertain, help them create time-limited safe-to-fail experiments. The outcome of the actions will then be learning and knowledge.

The 5D model is a powerful and effective communication structure because it breaks the way we usually think of improvements. By anchoring the discussion in what has actually worked instead of what does not work, we can increase motivation and enthusiasm and pave the way for future learnings.

The model does put a lot of responsibility on the facilitator, though. As you will notice, guiding the team through the model takes some careful balancing between guarded optimism and, well, unguarded optimism. The “landing curve” from Dream into Delivery can be tricky, especially if the team you are coaching has been conditioned over the years not to rock the boat. Make sure to help them out: talk to the managers; drop some words in the right places; bring the stakeholders’ attention to the right issues.
